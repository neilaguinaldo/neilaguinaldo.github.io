      <h1 class="display-4">Online climate misinformation is misrepresenting threats and delaying action.</h1><br>
      <p class="lh-base fs-5">
        Time is slipping away from us. There is no doubt the world must act now to avoid catastrophic ecological collapse.
        But climate action is being undermined by bad actors seeking to deflect, distract, and deny efforts to save the planet. 
        Disinformation, spread via social media, is their weapon of choice.
        Recent floods, droughts, wildfires, and heat waves have made denial of climate change more difficult. As a result, 
        climate denialists have resorted to alternative means to stall attempts to decarbonize the global economy. And their strategies are becoming more complex.
        Several climate scientists have claimed that they were duped into attending online seminars held by an organization that denies human activity is to blame 
        for climate change. The organization portrays the climate catastrophe as the "CO2 deception" and the "scam of the century," offering "the truth."<br>
        <br>
        The organization, which is said to have ties to conspiracists, invites high-profile speakers to speak at its gatherings. Later, other visitors told the BBC 
        that their statements had been distorted, taken out of context, or that they hadn't been informed of the group's viewpoints. Any misconduct by the organization is denied.
        These shady practices are far from uncommon. Those with a financial stake in keeping us addicted to fossil fuels are pouring money into think tanks and influencer campaigns 
        to sow doubt about climate science, disseminating everything from twisted stories to conspiracy theories and blatant lies.  
        A lot of this information comes from only a few places. According to the Center for Countering Digital Hate, eleven publications are responsible for 69 percent of all climate
        change denier content on Facebook. According to the analysis, ad income makes these falsehoods a profitable avenue for these companies.
         
         These initiatives strive to muddle the waters, erode agreement, and foment conflict, and renewable energy is a clear target. Big tobacco used similar methods to bury evidence 
         that connected smoking to cancer. Their reach has only grown thanks to the internet.<br>
         <br>
         And the fossil fuel lobby is pulling out all the stops. Bots on social media were discovered to be inventing and spreading falsehoods, automatically joining and dominating online 
         conversations, according to a research from 2021. Users disseminate the content, unaware that they are propagating false information.
         Recent research shows that these strategies work. The most recent UN IPCC assessment was the first to specifically include climate misinformation, claiming that "deliberate undermining 
         of science" was leading to "misperceptions of the scientific consensus, doubt, underestimated danger and urgency, and dissent."
         Meanwhile, the clock is ticking away. The science is clear: to stay inside the 1.5Â°C limit established in Paris, the world must decrease global emissions by 45 percent this decade. 
         If we're going to make it, we'll need everyone on board. That is why misinformation about climate change is so damaging.<br>
         <br>
         We all know there are no quick fixes for this. We need to do a better job of holding individuals who deliberately propagate harmful misinformation accountable, and we need to press for 
         stronger enforcement of Google's, YouTube's, Meta's, and Twitter's promises to ban or flag climate disinformation. However, exposing falsehoods is only half the battle.
         Communicators can assist audiences in recognizing incorrect material and symptoms of deception. Every individual who can expose bogus experts, conspiracies, and manipulated facts reduces the 
         number of people who fall for the traditional divert, distract, and deny strategies. One thing is undeniable. There is no more time to waste.
